# public_momapf

C++ Implementation of Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithms.

The code is distributed for academic and non-commercial use.

## Requirements

* We use CMake (3.16.3) and Make (4.2.1) to compile the code. Lower or higher version may also work.

## Project Structure

* `README.md` - This file
* `cpp/source/` - Contains the path planning source code
* `cpp/test/` - Contains example code for MO-CBS algorithms
* `cpp/include/` - Contains header files

## Instructions:

### Run MO-CBS

* Clone this repo
* Compile this repo
  * `mkdir build`
  * `cd build`
  * `cmake ..` (You can specify the build type you like by adding additional args)
  * `make`
* Run example in `./test_mocbs `
* This example shows how to use the code.
